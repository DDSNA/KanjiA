# KanjiApp

It's an app I'll be using to learn the generous amounts of kanji in the Japanese language.

It will contain:
1) A DB with images and instructionals for the most commonly used kanji
2) A search engine based on the romanji or their definition
3) A tracker for users of what they encountered so far
4) A challenge mode where selected kanji are thrown at the user and they must guess the romanji/definition
